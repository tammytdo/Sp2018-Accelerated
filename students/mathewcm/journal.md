#### Mathew C. Martin / UWPCE Spring 2018

This journal is intended for reference. It is not intended to be authoritative or a replacement for the published docs. I will attempt to provide sourcing information as best I can but much of the material is taken from open source and creative commons available for free online and from course materials provided for educational purposes and contained within the curriculum posted.

#### 18.4.19: Lesson 04

Recursion: If a function calls itself, we call that <em>recursion</em>.

Call Stack: Like with other functions, a call within a call establishes a <em>call stack</em>.

WTFs per minute: Docstrings and Comments can reduce the number of WTFs/minute

```
def sum_series(nth=1, sequence=(0, 1)):
    sequence = list(sequence)
    for i in range(2, nth):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-1])
    print(sequence)
    return sequence[nth-1]
```
Anytime you mutate a list you should use a shallow copy.

#### Trigrams
```
"I wish" => ["I", "I"]
"wish I" => ["may", "might"]
"may I" => ["wish"]
"I might"

sample = """Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the country"""

words = sample.split()

        first = words[i]
        second = words[i + 1]
        third = words[i + 2]
        print(first, second, third)

### 18.04.25

#### All the “set” operations from math class…

- s.isdisjoint(other)
- s.issubset(other)
- s.union(other, ...)
- s.intersection(other, ...)
- s.difference(other, ...)
- s.symmetric_difference( other, ...)



### 18.04.25.18:00

Had some difficulties with github and my git process. I think I somehow got out of sync during class but I'm not certain. What I do know is that git blame is a critical learning tool that one day will haunt my brute force style. I rolled back to a previous commit to get the merge conflicts to resolve. Somehow other students file changes were getting merge conflicts on my repo. git reset --hard <commit>

Life's challenges weigh heavily and the struggle if nothing else keeps the mind and muscle limber if a bit tender. While one door closes another opens in a thousand iterations I don't want to store. Given nifty tricks free to all; - I can sort thru with a bit less room than in overhead baggage.

"Life imitating art" and both are taking off for the stars. My google cultural institute project is in effect a collection and the metadata contained therein is precisely the use case I'm looking for. To both practice the innovative and open language of python and understand how best to give explicit name to the human spirit in a virtual namespace of digital simulacrum.

### 18.04.25.18:56

#### Common Idioms

```
for line in open('secrets.txt'):
    print(line)
```
(the file object is an iterator!)
```
f = open('secrets.txt')
while True:
    line = f.readline()
    if not line:
        break
    do_something_with_line()
```
### File Methods
#### Commonly Used File Methods:

- f.read()
- f.readline()  
- f.readlines()
- f.write(str)
- f.writelines(seq)
- f.seek(offset)
- f.tell() # for binary files, mostly
- f.close()

### All the stuff in os.path and more:
```
In [64]: import pathlib
In [65]: pth = pathlib.Path('./')
In [66]: pth.is_dir()
Out[66]: True
In [67]: pth.absolute()
Out[67]: PosixPath('/Users/Chris/PythonStuff/UWPCE/IntroPython2015')
In [68]: for f in pth.iterdir():
             print(f)
junk2.txt
junkfile.txt
```
### And it has a really nifty way to join paths, by overloading the “division” operator:
```
In [49]: p = pathlib.Path.home()  # create a path to the user home dir.

In [50]: p
Out[50]: PosixPath('/Users/Chris')

In [51]: p / "a_dir" / "one_more" / "a_filename"
Out[51]: PosixPath('/Users/Chris/a_dir/one_more/a_filename')
```

### 18.4.28.10:00

Saturday morning and all is quiet on the NW front. The weather has us boxed in pining for the 70 degree days not long absent. Wrestling the Zen that is Python, a struggle of both mind and muscle.

Sorting information manually has always been something I loathed, not enough patience to ever find satisfaction in that enterprise. However, loaded to bear with effective tools, it is something I can find instant pleasure. Looking forward to understanding how to implement logic and computer processing power in a practical manner. I've worked as an archivist and administrator and can see how important and powerful these tools in coordinating just about any modern endeavor.

### 18.4.28.10:10

#### Assignment: Mailroom, Part 2

Update mailroom program to do the following:

- Use dicts where appropriate
- See if you can use a dict to switch between the users selections. See Using a Dictionary to switch (Using a Dictionary to switch)[https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/modules/DictionaryAsSwitch.html#dict-as-switch]
- Try to use a dict and the .format() method to do the letter as one big template rather than building up a big string in parts.


<!-- Look up Open() syntax... f.write(create_letter(donor)) -->

### IPython

(IPython Tips & Tricks)[http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tips.html]

#### Help in IPython

Any built-in, method or attribute followed by a "?" gives a brief description in IPython.

 For windows-based systems, the default aliases are ‘copy’, ‘ddir’, ‘echo’, ‘ls’, ‘ldir’, ‘mkdir’, ‘ren’, and ‘rmdir’.

#### Embed IPython in your programs
A few lines of code are enough to load a complete IPython inside your own programs, giving you the ability to work with your data interactively after automatic processing has been completed. See the embedding section.

### Dictionary Comprehensions or "dict comps"

```
new_dict = { key: value for variable in a_sequence}

names = ['fred', 'John', 'MARY']
ids = [1, 2, 3]
d = dict(zip(names,ids))

d
Out[53]: {'John': 2, 'MARY': 3, 'fred': 1}

d = {id: name for id, name in zip(ids, names) if name != 'MARY'}

d
Out[55]: {1: 'fred', 2: 'John'}
```

### Collections module

(Python Docs on collections module)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html]

- namedtuple(): factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
- deque: list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end
- Counter: dict subclass for counting hashable objects
- OrderedDict: dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added
- defaultdict: dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
- ChainMap: dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings

- UserDict: wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing
- UserList: wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing
- UserString: wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing

(Collections module overview)[https://pymotw.com/3/collections/]

### defaultdict()

```
from collections import defaultdict

dd = defaultdict(list)
dd['this'].append(23)
dd
Out[60]: defaultdict(list, {'this': [23]})
dd['this'].append(4)
dd['this'].append(4)
dd
Out[63]: defaultdict(list, {'this': [23, 4, 4]})
dd['that'].append(4)
dd
Out[65]: defaultdict(list, {'that': [4], 'this': [23, 4, 4]})
dd['those'].append(8)
dd
Out[67]: defaultdict(list, {'that': [4], 'this': [23, 4, 4], 'those': [8]})
dd['those'].append(16)
dd['those'].append(32)
dd['those'].pop()
Out[70]: 32
dd
Out[71]: defaultdict(list, {'that': [4], 'this': [23, 4, 4], 'those': [8, 16]})

comprehension[2]
{'Orangutans'}
```
#### Close!

### Filtering lists with list comprehensions
```
len(feast)
Out[86]: 5
len(comp)
Out[87]: 3
```
### Unpacking tuples in list Comprehensions
```
list_of_tuples = [(1, 'lumberjack'), (2, 'inquisition'), (4, 'spam')]
comprehension = [ skit * number for number, skit in list_of_tuples]

comprehension[0]
Out[90]: 'lumberjack'

comprehension[2]
Out[91]: 'spamspamspamspam'
```
I got the first right but thought it was 8*spam for the second not 4 * spam. I mulitplied by the index... ???
```
len(comprehension[2])
Out[92]: 16
```
Missed the len()...

### Double list Comprehensions
```
eggs = ['poached egg', 'fried egg']
meats = ['lite spam', 'ham spam', 'fried spam']
comprehension = [ '{0} and {1}'.format(egg, meat) for egg in eggs for meat in meats]
len(comprehension)
Out[98]: 6
comprehension[0]
Out[99]: 'poached egg and lite spam'
comprehension = { c for c in 'aabbbcccc'}
comprehension
Out[101]: {'a', 'b', 'c'}
```
### Set comprehensions
<!-- sets are immutable requiring a unique key which only one can exist in any given sequence.-->
```
comprehension = { c for c in 'aabbbcccc'}
comprehension
Out[101]: {'a', 'b', 'c'}
```

### Dictionary Comprehensions
```
dict_of_weapons = {'first': 'fear',
                    'second': 'surprise',
                    'third': 'ruthless efficiency',
                    'forth': 'fanatical devotion',
                    'fifth': None}

What is the output?
```
[a for a in dir(str) if a[0] != "_"]
```
### Unit testing
```
unittest?
Type:        module
String form: <module 'unittest' from 'd:\\Anaconda3\\lib\\unittest\\__init__.py'>
File:        d:\anaconda3\lib\unittest\__init__.py
Docstring:  
Python unit testing framework, based on Erich Gamma's JUnit and Kent Beck's
Smalltalk testing framework (used with permission).

This module contains the core framework classes that form the basis of
specific test cases and suites (TestCase, TestSuite etc.), and also a
text-based utility class for running the tests and reporting the results
 (TextTestRunner).

Simple usage:

    import unittest

    class IntegerArithmeticTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def testAdd(self):  # test method names begin with 'test'
            self.assertEqual((1 + 2), 3)
            self.assertEqual(0 + 1, 1)
        def testMultiply(self):
            self.assertEqual((0 * 10), 0)
            self.assertEqual((5 * 8), 40)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

### Python's Class Development Toolkit

#### Agile Methodology
- Out with waterfall: Design Code Test Ship
- In with: Tight iterations
- Let little bits of design, coding and testing inform later bits of design, coding and testing
- The core idea is iterate and adapt quickly
- MVP Minimum Value Product
- Add Commit Push

##### Initialize instance variables

- __init__ isn't a constructor. It's job is to initialize the instance variables.
- Regular methods have "self" as first argument.

##### Class variables for shared data

- Don't use floating point numbers for a version.
- Minimum viable product: Ship it!

```
class Circle:
    'An advanced circle analytic toolkit'

    version = '0.1'         # class variable

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius            # instance variable

    def area(self):
        'Perform quadrature on a shape of uniform radius'
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2.0

    c = Circle(10)
    print('Circuituous version', Circle.version)

    print('A circle of radius', c.radius)
    print('has an area of', c.area())
    print()
```

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

#### Alternative Constructors *** Know this methods (Polymorphism)

#### Super

1. The method being called by super needs to exist
2. Caller and the called need to have matching argument signatures
3. Every occurance of the method needs to use Super

#### super
1. Init signature: super(self, /, *args, \**kwargs)
2. Docstring:

  * super(type, obj) -> bound super object; requires isinstance(obj, type)
  * super(type, type2) -> bound super object; requires issubclass(type2, type)

#### From class materials

[UWPCE Canvas Spring 2018 Accelerated](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1197533/assignments/4129941?module_item_id=8240380)

Checking If It’s The Right Type
How do you decide if the wrapper is required?

Checking if it’s an instance of Element:

You could check and see if the object being appended is an Element:
```
if isinstance(content, Element):
    self.content.append(content)
else:
    self.content.append(TextWrapper(content))
```

This would work well, but closes the door to using any other type that may not be a strict subclass of Element, but can render itself. Not too bad in this case, but in general, frowned upon in Python.

Alternatively, you could check for the string type:
```
if isinstance(content, str):
    self.content.append(TextWrapper(content))
else:
    self.content.append(content)
```
I think this is a little better – strings are a pretty core type in Python, so it’s not likely that anyone is going to need to use a “string-like” object.


#### isinstance(object, classinfo)

- isinstance(object, classinfo)
Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns false. If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised.

#### Metaclasses in Python: A metaclass is the class of the classes

[Metaclasses](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-are-metaclasses-in-python)


A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves, a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.

![alt text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QQ0OK.png "Metaclasses")

While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. type is the usual metaclass in Python. In case you're wondering, yes, type is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won't be able to recreate something like type purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type.

A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. Like you create an instance of the class by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the 'class' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal __init__ and __new__ methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do 'extra things' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry, or even replace the class with something else entirely.

When the class statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the class statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the __metaclass__ attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the __metaclass__ global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it.

However, metaclasses actually define the type of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods, in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. type.__subclasses__() is an example of a method on the type metaclass. You can also define the normal 'magic' methods, like __add__, __iter__ and __getattr__, to implement or change how the class behaves.

Here's an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:

```
def make_hook(f):
    """Decorator to turn 'foo' method into '__foo__'"""
    f.is_hook = 1
    return f

class MyType(type):
    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, attrs):

        if name.startswith('None'):
            return None

        # Go over attributes and see if they should be renamed.
        newattrs = {}
        for attrname, attrvalue in attrs.iteritems():
            if getattr(attrvalue, 'is_hook', 0):
                newattrs['__%s__' % attrname] = attrvalue
            else:
                newattrs[attrname] = attrvalue

        return super(MyType, mcls).__new__(mcls, name, bases, newattrs)

    def __init__(self, name, bases, attrs):
        super(MyType, self).__init__(name, bases, attrs)

        # classregistry.register(self, self.interfaces)
        print "Would register class %s now." % self

    def __add__(self, other):
        class AutoClass(self, other):
            pass
        return AutoClass
        # Alternatively, to autogenerate the classname as well as the class:
        # return type(self.__name__ + other.__name__, (self, other), {})

    def unregister(self):
        # classregistry.unregister(self)
        print "Would unregister class %s now." % self
```

#### 7.5 StringIO --- Read and write strings as files
This module implements a file-like class, StringIO, that reads and writes a string buffer (also known as memory files). See the description of file objects for operations (section File Objects). (For standard strings, see str and unicode.)
```
class StringIO.StringIO([buffer])
```
- When a StringIO object is created, it can be initialized to an existing string by passing the string to the constructor. If no string is given, the StringIO will start empty. In both cases, the initial file position starts at zero.
- The StringIO object can accept either Unicode or 8-bit strings, but mixing the two may take some care. If both are used, 8-bit strings that cannot be interpreted as 7-bit ASCII (that use the 8th bit) will cause a UnicodeError to be raised when getvalue() is called.
- The following methods of StringIO objects require special mention:
```
StringIO.getvalue()
```
- Retrieve the entire contents of the “file” at any time before the StringIO object’s close() method is called. See the note above for information about mixing Unicode and 8-bit strings; such mixing can cause this method to raise
```
UnicodeError.
```
```
StringIO.close()
```
Free the memory buffer. Attempting to do further operations with a closed StringIO object will raise a ValueError.

Example usage:
```
import StringIO

output = StringIO.StringIO()
output.write('First line.\n')
print >>output, 'Second line.'

# Retrieve file contents -- this will be
# 'First line.\nSecond line.\n'
contents = output.getvalue()

# Close object and discard memory buffer --
# .getvalue() will now raise an exception.
output.close()

#### 7.6. cStringIO — Faster version of StringIO
- The module cStringIO provides an interface similar to that of the StringIO module. Heavy use of StringIO.StringIO objects can be made more efficient by using the function StringIO() from this module instead.
```
cStringIO.StringIO([s])
```
- Return a StringIO-like stream for reading or writing.
- Since this is a factory function which returns objects of built-in types, there’s no way to build your own version using subclassing. It’s not possible to set attributes on it. Use the original StringIO module in those cases.
- Unlike the StringIO module, this module is not able to accept Unicode strings that cannot be encoded as plain ASCII strings.
- Another difference from the StringIO module is that calling StringIO() with a string parameter creates a read-only object. Unlike an object created without a string parameter, it does not have write methods. These objects are not generally visible. They turn up in tracebacks as StringI and StringO.
- The following data objects are provided as well:
```
cStringIO.InputType
```
- The type object of the objects created by calling StringIO() with a string parameter.
```
cStringIO.OutputType
```
- The type object of the objects returned by calling StringIO() with no parameters.
- There is a C API to the module as well; refer to the module source for more information.

Example usage:
```
import cStringIO

output = cStringIO.StringIO()
output.write('First line.\n')
print >>output, 'Second line.'

# Retrieve file contents -- this will be
# 'First line.\nSecond line.\n'
contents = output.getvalue()

# Close object and discard memory buffer --
# .getvalue() will now raise an exception.
output.close()
```


#### 16.2 io --- Core tools for working with streams Source code: Lib/io.py

[16.2.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html)

##### 16.2.1. Overview
The io module provides Python’s main facilities for dealing with various types of I/O. There are three main types of I/O: text I/O, binary I/O and raw I/O. These are generic categories, and various backing stores can be used for each of them. A concrete object belonging to any of these categories is called a file object. Other common terms are stream and file-like object.

Independently of its category, each concrete stream object will also have various capabilities: it can be read-only, write-only, or read-write. It can also allow arbitrary random access (seeking forwards or backwards to any location), or only sequential access (for example in the case of a socket or pipe).

All streams are careful about the type of data you give to them. For example giving a str object to the write() method of a binary stream will raise a TypeError. So will giving a bytes object to the write() method of a text stream.

Changed in version 3.3: Operations that used to raise IOError now raise OSError, since IOError is now an alias of OSError.

#### Finished HTML Renderer exercise with 7/ 7 tests passing without factoring in indentation

Thanks to Kristian and Andy both whose code I referred to in working thru my solution. I incorporated Kristian's `**kwarg` approach and could understand the looping and key, value arguments after seeing them implemented so well. I added additional tags and hope to revisit this exercise and finish the indentations as it would in fact make the renderer more readable.

### 18.5.10.12:30

Focusing on the low fruit today and cleanup in preparation for more difficult refactoring of the mailroom project. Submission of both the Kata Fourteen: Tom Swift Under Milk Wood and the Circle Class exercises. Both should be well documented and I doubt I will face any major blocks today. The final date for submission is 18.5.14.23:59. D-4.45 Attempting to maximize course points given limited timeframe.

Taking good notes and having well documented course materials has proven to be highly beneficial while sharpening my markdown language proficiency. The output looks highly professional and integrates into my workflow with Anaconda Spyder3 as well as Atom very nicely. Keeping my journal open and capturing salient points almost randomly without missing stride toward my coding objectives.

Being able to reference pertinent information and having the means to access it from 'virtually' anywhere is a powerful application of technology. Updating it and sharing it openly is its own form of humanity, filling the void with light even if but bits of some random memory.

#### Using RegEx re.findall for text manipulation

##### Using re.findall for text
`Re.findall()` module is used when you want to iterate over the lines of the file, it will return a list of all the matches in a single step. For example, here we have a list of e-mail addresses, and we want all the e-mail addresses to be fetched out from the list, we use the re.findall method. It will find all the e-mail addresses from the list.

Python Regex Tutorial: re.match(), re.search(), re.findall(), Flags

Here is the complete code
```
import re

list = ["guru99 get", "guru99 give", "guru Selenium"]
for element in list:
    z = re.match("(g\w+)\W(g\w+)", element)
if z:
    print((z.groups()))

patterns = ['software testing', 'guru99']
text = 'software testing is fun?'
for pattern in patterns:
    print('Looking for "%s" in "%s" ->' % (pattern, text), end=' ')
    if re.search(pattern, text):
        print('found a match!')
else:
    print('no match')
abc = 'guru99@google.com, careerguru99@hotmail.com, users@yahoomail.com'
emails = re.findall(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+', abc)
for email in emails:
    print(email)
```    
#### Python Flags
Many Python Regex Methods and Regex functions take an optional argument called Flags. This flags can modify the meaning of the given Regex pattern. To understand these we will see one or two example of these Flags.

Various flags used in Python includes

Syntax for Regex Flags	What does this flag do

| [re.M] |	Make begin/end consider each line          |
| ------ |:-------------------------------------------:|
| [re.I] |	It ignores case                            |
| [re.S] |	Make [ . ]                                 |
| [re.U] |	Make { \w,\W,\b,\B} follows Unicode rules  |
| [re.L] |	Make {\w,\W,\b,\B} follow locale           |
| [re.X] |	Allow comment in Regex                     |

### 18.5.10.15:30 Trigrams completed

Trigrams works after much tweaking. Incorporated Andy Kwon's brilliant regex solution for removing special characters. Code could use a little drying. Satisfied with result and my understanding. Moving on to Circle.py excercise before submitting another PR. Don't want to hold myself up waiting for grading at this time and want to continue to power on.

I will have to code my count down clock to deadlines like course submission. Trying to hold to lexicographical order in my date format got me thinking about the D-Day type countdown and how it helps motivate one toward significant milestones.

```

Out[153]: 31404

```
#### D-3.14:04

That's 3 days 14 hours and 4 minutes with pretty simple math and by parsing out my periods and colons.

Just a function definition and a f string away from a new countdown module.

Back to it! Goals for today are to finish circle.py and feeling more confident with using asserts and testing objects using exceptions and logic. I want to dig deeper into classes and get a better handle on how they are used in python. The knowledge that `type` is a class itself was hugely insightful. I'm feeling more and more confidence in peeking under the hood.

I should thank all my mentors in this process as it does not come naturally. Those willing and able to guide me from the darkness and shed light where for me none previously existed, is in fact a wonderful sight to see. I'm forever indebted to their selfless service to me. Restoring my trust in my fellow human and revitalizing my quest to fulfill my greater dreams. On the path forward toward the mountaintop where I hope to share a vista both beautiful and glorious beyond all our means.

### 18.5.12.08:36

Thinking about life while at coffee and how much coding has helped me give a framework to the stressors I feel daily. I actually started thinking about issues in a stack and popping off those which rise mysteriously daily to the top of the seemingly endless iterations. Having the means to move forward and address them singularly and not wholly is the only logical path and that which I know is manageable. Given the magnitude of any single persons struggle with mortality, it seems we can only take one step at a time though when perceived collectively, the mountaintop seems so so far away. Yet, it is the burden itself, the character of struggle and the story of our sacrifice that motivates me day upon day, week upon week, year upon year, until that fateful day. In magnitudes I have yet to understand... though currently it seems only a class away.

#### Current class point assessment

In [7]: 195. / 225.
Out[7]: 0.8666666666666667

Of a possible 225 points by my visual count from the Class Canvas page att I have 195 points. Missing as currently ungraded is Kata Fourteen: Tom Swift Under Milk Wood which I submitted with the latest PR late last night. On Canvas I then submitted Circle Exercise and Mailroom 4 all this AM. If this assessment is good then I believe I've passed the first portion of the course. Assuming 87% is passing. Onward and upward.

I still need to finish the last classes notes and course materials including refactoring mailroom as functional then for OO with a Donor Class and a UI class per notes. However, I have a ton of personal matters I've been putting off for course completion priorities weighing down on me. I may just clear the deck this AM for my own sanity.

I'm glad to see no study group today because I'm really not prepared in all honesty. I need to have some code together and a plan to share with Hosung tomorrow. My goals for today are to prepare for that reality by reviewing materials and to understanding the exercise explicitly. Then develop my class implementation approach with a repeatable Methodology that I can then apply more broadly with a deeper understanding and logical means. So much material but I think it is really coming together at least abstractly.
