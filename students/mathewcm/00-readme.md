This repo is forked off the offical class repository located at: https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert-ClassRepos/Sp2018-Accelerated

This repository and its contents are for the purpose of gaining knowledge and understanding of the Python Coding Language. In the spirit of open access to information and the preservation of ideas that embolden human wisdom and truth please feel free to share.

The naming system for folders will be based on lessons with documents named for excercises organized within. Ex: /lesson1/excercise1

My objective in learning Python is to help organize and codify historically significant artifacts and information into perpetuity. I'm actively involved in the Heritage Community and hope to further my passions thru more intelligent and refined processes. Python seems a wonderful fit for me.
